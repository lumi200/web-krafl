            <h2>What is Web Typography...and why does it matter?</h2>
            <p>What is Web Typography? Well...some call it a technique, some call it art, and I call it underrated.
                Simply put, it is the art, design, and arrangement of text. But why is it underrated? Because if it
                works, you won't notice it. If it doesn't, you will be repulsed and leave the website with an uneasy
                feeling.</p>
            <p>Web Typography determines how text looks to the user, the reader of a website. It's not only about
                choosing the right font, but also about spacing, text layout, and many more details. These details
                define the tone and vibe of your project. Do you know any website or application that has no text on
                it?
                Text is all over your website - and Typography is the clothes your words wear. So don't think ever
                again
                that good Typography Design consists only of choosing the right font. Rightly chosen fonts improve
                the
                readability of your website, or make it unreadable! And the same can be said about the uniqueness of
                your website - taking overused fonts may let your website look very bland - do you want that? So
                choosing fonts is not simply choosing fonts after all!</p>

        <div>
            <h2>What do you have to consider when choosing Fonts?</h2>
            <p>"That font looks neat; let's choose that."
                If you believe this is the right approach, I'm sorry to disappoint you.</p>
            <p>Certainly, that's not the way to go. Fonts are more than just about the looks.
                But don't worry, here is a checklist for you to determine what's important when choosing a font:</p>
            <!-- <p>Before we go through it, the terms "font" and "typeface" are often confused or used interchangeably. What we commonly call a "font" is actually a "typeface." A typeface is the design of letters, numbers, and symbols, while a font is a specific variation, like Helvetica bold.</p> -->
            <h3><strong>Bad Typeface?</strong></h3>
            <p>Rule No.1: There are no bad typefaces, only badly used typefaces.</p>
            <h3><strong>Text is not Text</strong></h3>
            <p>Text can be categorized into three types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Display text: Short and large text, such as titles, should catch the reader's attention and
                    define
                    the vibe of your project.
                </li>
                <li>Body text: Main content text. Good body text should be readable and not draw too much attention.
                </li>
                <li>Functional text: Used for navigation elements, labels, etc., and should work well in small
                    sizes.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3><strong>What's the main use?</strong></h3>
            <p>Consider the purpose of your text:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If people will read a lot on your website, focus on a good readable body size typeface.</li>
                <li>If it needs to draw attention with minimal text, focus on striking headlines.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><strong>Who is your audience?</strong></h3>
            <p>Often overlooked but important â€“ how accessible is your typeface?
                Does your typeface affect people with disabilities in a negative way? Does it fit well on phones,
                and
                what about dark mode?</p>
            <h3><strong>Weight and Style</strong></h3>
            <p>Weights of a typeface describe the thickness variations. Consider:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you only need it for headings, one bold weight might be enough.
                <li>If you need body text, you'll need a regular weight and perhaps another for emphasis.
                <li>For abbreviations, think about typefaces with "small-cap" support.
                <li>For tiny text, look for medium weights with sturdy strokes.
                <li>Check if your desired typeface supports basic punctuation.
            </ul>
            <h3><strong>Language Support</strong></h3>
            <p>Ensure the typeface supports all characters of the language you're using.
                Avoid issues by searching for fonts by language (Google Fonts).</p>
            <h3><strong>Special Characters</strong></h3>
            <p>Do you need extras like special characters, symbols, and alternative letters?
                Look for OpenType-supported typefaces.</p>
            <h3><strong>Can we afford it?</strong></h3>
            <p>Most good typefaces aren't free, and if they are, they're often overused.
                Investing in unique typefaces means investing in the uniqueness of your project.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>How fonts feel and pair</h2>
            <p>While fonts can be categorized into specific, applying them strictly might not always give a great
                result. Many typefaces blur the
                line between those categories. Rather than follow the categories and their use cases, you should
                look
                at a font separately and experiment what
                fits best for your project. Still, the categories and what feeling they convey might be helpful to
                start</p>
            <h3 class="sans-serif">Sans Serif</h3>
            <p class="sans-serif">Sans Serif looks modern, looks simple, minimal and clean. Usually, all strokes of
                the Font are the same width. Sans-Serif fonts are the most used category when in comes to the web.
                They are fine if you need them for long text bodies, for a user interface or as Headings
                or as Headings</p>
            <h3 class="serif">Serif</h3>
            <p class="serif">Serif typefaces have tapers on them and have been used since the 15th century in
                printing. These fonts give a warm, traditional and trustworthy feeling. They are good for headings
                and long text bodies, but shouldn't be used in an interface.
            <h3 class="slab">Slab Serif</h3>
            <p class="slab">The Slab Serif fonts are less smooth and have more hard edges. They were invented in the
                19th Century and look "wild western". They give of a stable, confident and clunky feeling. Same as
                the Serif fonts, they can be used for text bodies and headings, but shouldn't be used in an
                interface
            </p>
            <h3 class="script">Script</h3>
            Script fonts are the opposite of simple and clean, they are inspired by calligraphy typefaces. The
            category for this typeface is very broad and includes many styles. This typeface should exclusively be
            used for headings.<span class="script"> Because else, readability suffers a lot. </span>
            <h3 class="handwritten">Handwritten</h3>
            <p>While script fonts try to be fancy, handwritten fonts try to be relatable and "normal" and give of a
                human, friendly and authentic feeling. Same as the script fonts, this should only be used as a
                heading. <span class="handwritten">While not as difficult to read as most script fonts, it's still
                        harder compared to other fonts</span></p>
            <h3 class="display">Display</h3>
            <p>
                Display fonts, to simplify, is everything that doesn't fit in a category above. These typefaces can
                be very atmospheric. Since they can look very different, they don't give of any specific feeling,
                rather they strike in their unique. Still, they should only be used in a heading.

            <h2>Typography as design element</h2>
            <p>
                Another aspect of typography is the measurements of the fonts. Especially font size, line height and
                line length play an important role in designing the text bodies. Depending on what purpose the
                website is going to serve, different design choices should be made. For example, when making a
                website focusing on promoting a product, the main focus should be on the headers. When designing a
                blog site, the text body should be your main focus.
            </p>

            <h3>The body</h3>
            <p> When creating the body, the font should not be less than <span class="unit">1em</span> while on the
                desktop you can increase it to <span class="unit">1.5em</span>
            </p>
            <h3>Main Heading</h3>
            <p>
                The normal heading is small for the desktop and a bit too big for the phone. Therefore, it's
                recommended to go up to do <span class="unit">2em</span> on mobile and <span class="unit">4em</span>
                on desktop.
            </p>

            <h3>Function Text</h3>
            <p>
                Text like captions and navigational aids should always be smaller than the body. For phones, it's
                recommended to keep it at <span class="unit">0.75em</span> and for desktop you can go up to <span
                    class="unit">1em</span>
            </p>

            <p>A good rule of thumb is to always increase the size of fonts on the desktop size desktop screen are
                bigger and therefore further away from the user.
            </p>


            <!--
            ka ob ma des brauchen,is i glab zu "komplex" was aber nit wie i sonnst erklÃ¤ren warum 24px nit 24px font sant
        <hr style="border:solid; border-width: 1px;">

            <h3>Line height</h3>

       <p> You may have noticed that sometimes 2 fonts don't look the same height even if both fonts are set to
        for example<span class="unit">100px</span> This is because when you specify <span class="unit">fontsize:
            100px;</span> the font won't have a size of 100px. Rather the size of the font will be determent the
        em-square from the font itself. You may have noticed when viewing throught the inspector in the devtools
        that the text never touches the borders of the element even with <span class="unit">padding:0px;</span>.
        This is the result of the em-square, a relative container provided by the font itself and can vary by a
        lot.<p>>

            <h2>How Fonts Affect Responsive Design & Web Performance</h2>
            <p>Fonts affect the responsive design of a website. Responsive typography ensures that Text is readable
                across various devices with different screen sizes and different screen resolutions. For this it is
                advised to use font units that are relative either to the biggest headline or the viewport. One can also
                utilize media queries to use different fonts depending on the screen size of the device. Checking if a
                font supports every Language when working on international projects is crucial.
            </p>
            <h3> Performance </h3>
            <p>
                Fonts not only contribute to the aesthetics of a website but also have a profound impact on its
                performance. So how do fonts affect the performance?
            </p>
            <h4> Loading speed</h4>
            <p>
                Custom web fonts have to be loaded from external servers or services (for example Google Fonts). This
                requires additional HTTP-requests, which can lead to latency and longer load times. Additionally, this
                mean that a websites performance is reliant on the availability and speed of external services.
            </p>
            <h4> Render Blocking</h4>
            <p>
                Due to the default behavior of CSS treating fonts as resources that must be loaded before the page is
                fully rendered, fonts can cause a delay in the initial rendering of a webpage. This delay, known as the
                Flash of Invisible Text (FOIT), can result in a blank screen until the custom font is fully loaded.
            </p>
        </div>
    </section>
    <section>
        <a class="anchor" id="variable-fonts"></a>
        <div>
            <h2>Variable Fonts - A New Era in Typography</h2>
            <p>To understand what variable fonts are, we need to understand regular/static fonts first. A font can come
                in different variations, for example: font size, font weight, bold, italics. All these things are axes.
                <br>
                Normally all the different variations of a font along any axis are stored in a separate file. To
                have 1 font in normal, italics, bold and bold italics, one would need to load 4 separate files, that is
                not great for performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                That is where variable fonts enter the picture, they are highly efficient, compressed files including
                many different permutations of a font. This file is usually bigger than a standard font file, but
                usually much smaller than the many different font files one might normally need. <br>
                But variable fonts are not only better for performance, but they can also improve readability as well.
                When using a different size, it can be helpful to accordingly adjust the weight of the font.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since one can change so much using a variable font, how does one do this? <br>
                Variable fonts have lots of different axes. The actual number of changes depending on the specific
                typeface. Most of them will have the 5 registered axes: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Weight (represented by the wght tag)</li>
                <li> Width (wdth tag)</li>
                <li> italic (ital tag)</li>
                <li> slant (slnt tag)</li>
                <li> Optical size (opsz tag)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                There are also custom axes. So, fonts may also be adjusted on these. <br>
                To change a custom axis, one must use font-variation-settings. An important note here is that
                the names are case-sensitive. The registered axis names must be in lower case, and custom axes
                must be in upper case.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since so many things can be customized using variable fonts, it is easy to be overwhelmed with
                the seemingly infinite number of options. This is one of the downsides of variable fonts. <br>
                Sometimes there are way too many axes with very large ranges, those files can be massive.
                This is another downside to variable fonts. Luckily there is a solution to this Problem. Some
                variable fonts come in multiple files, mostly a separate file for italics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Variable fonts have been supported by all mayor browsers since 2018. </p>
