# about our code examples

## font consideration
In the first example, we're comparing a basic text with no styling to a nicely formatted text.
The difference comes from a few CSS rules.
Each rule might not seem like a big deal on its own, but when you put them all together, it literally feels like another text.

## font comparison
Here we are comparing how not to do fonts with how to do fonts.

## font design
This example shows that font shouldn't be fixed to a single size.
On mobile devices, this text will be smaller since this device is usually closer to the eyes.
On desktop, the fonts will be larger since desktop screens are larger and further away.

## variable fonts
In this example we are playing with variable fonts.
Using sliders we are changing the registered axes on a font.
